Little is known about the history of the first age of the Orbis Terrarvum. Those were the dark ages, when the primitive tribes of menn fought against the brutality of nature, trying to carve a place for themselves upon the continent. These orcs had no writing, and so no recorded history, and their language itself was primitive. The legends cannot even agree whether this age lasted a hundred years, or a thousand years.

All we know is that at the beginning of the age, when the orcs first arrived on Evrosia, they numbered only a few small tribes, and by the end of the age, before the men appeared on the continent in the south-east, they had lit fires in camps from the great steppes in the north-west to the fertile plains and forests in the east.
