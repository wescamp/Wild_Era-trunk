He has abandoned the tribe, and the fire, and struck out on his own. He is a skilled enough spearman that the monsters do not pose a lethal threat to him, most of the time, and just to be sure, he has poisoned some of his spears for battle. He is feared by both monsters and menn."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
